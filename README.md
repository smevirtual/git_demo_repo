# Git Demonstration Repository

This repository is for all SME Virtual Network workshop participants who are learning Git.

Try to add a Markdown file (.md file) with your name as the file name and a short description about yourself within the file. Use a different branch from master to add your changes and submit a GitHub pull request. This is a very common workflow pattern when using Git to contribute to your own project or any other open-source project.
